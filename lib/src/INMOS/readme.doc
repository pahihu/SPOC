The command line

         make -f Makefile.tp

or

         make -f Makefile.tp all

if given from .../build/libs/occ/tp will cause a build of the C
catenations, the FORTRAN catenations, the occam2 toolset libraries and
the occam configurer library, occonfio.lib, leaving the desiderata in
.../build/libs/occ/tp; relevant .inc, .lnk and .liu files will also be
copied to this directory. It will also cause the sources of those
libraries that are given away with the occam2 toolset to be copied into
a set of directories under .../occ/tp/rel.


The command line

	make -f Makefile.tp test

will do some testing of the libraries, leaving test.log in
.../build/libs/occ/src, and more detailed logs in .../build/libs/occ/tp/TESTS.


ISEARCH *must* have .../build/libs/occ/tp/  in it.
OCCAMLIBS *must* be .../build/libs/occ/tp .
