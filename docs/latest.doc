SPOC Version 1.1
----------------

Bugs:

File system write errors are not trapped during translation by occ2c,
thus if the filing-system fills or any other errors occur, occ2c will
not notice and will return a successful exit status.

Several Intrinsic functions call library routines, which may not be present
on all systems. These include:
  o DNEXTAFTER() calls nextafter()
  o REAL32REM()  calls remainder()
  o REAL64REM()  calls remainder()
  o IEEE32REM()  calls remainder()
  o IEEE64REM()  calls remainder()
  o LOGB()       calls ilogb()
  o DLOGB()      calls ilogb()

The OCCAM floating point remainder operator is implemented via a call
to remainder(), which may not be present on all systems.
